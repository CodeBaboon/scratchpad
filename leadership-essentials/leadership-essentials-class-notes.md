Dream Teams
===========

## Module 2.1 - Intro

### Team Qualities
- Distribution (centralized vs. remote)
- Composition (cross-functional vs. specialized)
- Structure (hierarchical vs. flat)
- Duration (built-from-scratch vs. legacy)

### Flat structure tips/tricks
- open communication of vision and values
- demonstrate trust in your team (take your hands off the wheel)
- be open and approachable
- transparent decision making

### Summary
No matter how a team is distributed, structured, or composed, the goal of any leader is to help support their team and incorporate the structures and strategies to help them be the best, most-productive, high-performing team it can be.

## Module 2.2 - High Performance Teams

### Traits
- Share a common, clearly defined goal
- Clear sense of individual role and purpose
- Engage in meaningful, authentic converstation
- Embrace (healthy) conflict

### Key Ideas
1. That every individual brings a unique set of skills, interests, perspectives, and strengths to the team. 
2. Leadership is not located outside or above the team, but within it.

### Summary
High performing teams recognize and lean upon their individual strengths and talents, putting them to use towards a shared, common goal.

## Module 2.3 - Stages of Team Development

### The Stages
1. Forming - team lacks clarity and shared goals, people are friendly and conflict averse as they attempt to figure out how they fit into the group
2. Storming - clarity of individual purpose and roles, but still some uncertainty. Factions may form, decision-making is a struggle, conflict starts to form.
3. Norming - roles and responsibility clear, consensus forms. Decison-making becomes easier as trust and relationships form.
4. Performing - team has shared vision. disagreements are handled postively. team works towards goal but also attends to relationships, styles, and process issues.
5. Adjourning - group break-up

### Leadership role per stage
1. Forming - Direction (what/when/why/how, oversee completion at each stage, frequent check-ins and support)
2. Storming - Support (two-way communication, general direction, evaluate progress, guidance "as needed")
3. Norming - Facilitating (remove obstacles, ensure team has time, tools, and resources)
4. Performing - Delegate (assign tasks and responsibility, including oversight, to other team members)
5. Adjourning - Host a party and discuss next steps

### Rules of Engagement
- agreed upon values regarding ways to communicate and overcome challenges
- start/stop/continue (retro-style) brainstorming for improvement

### Working with Established Teams
1. Reframe the problem from a “legacy” issue to a “current” issue 
2. Take the time to understand the root cause of the problem, without judgment
3. Be reflective of the potential part you have had to play in the situation
4. Have the moxie to intervene

### Summary
Team development isn’t a straight and linear path. There may be times where your team returns to some previous stage-- and that’s o.k. Your job as a leader is to understand what variables have contributed to your team entering a particular stage and consider what you as a leader can do to help get them to the next one.

## Module 2.4 - Leading your team through change 

### People's reaction to change
1. People respond to change differently
2. People accept change at different rates
3. Resistance to change is normal and to be expected

### Systems-Thinking
- Systems-thinking is a holistic approach to analysis and problem-solving.
- it is about taking the time to fully understand the numerous variables that impact people's actions and behaviours

### Nudging Change
1. Simplify procedures
2. Alerts/reminders (not calling out, but subtle social pressures)
3. Solicited pre-commitment (conversations before change to help get commitment before it hits)
4. Default settings (opt-out instead of opt-in)

### Summary
Taking the time to hear-out your team’s questions, address their concerns, and outline expectations for the change can go far in ensuring that the change is not only adopted but embraced by your team. 

## Module 2.5 - Supporting Team Performance

### Engagement vs. Motivation
- Engagement refers to a sense of emotional involvement or commitment to a particular task, activity, or organization.
- Motivation is the reason (or reasons) for acting or behaving in a particular way. It is the desire or willingness people have to do something.

### Five reasons employees do not perform optimally
1. Communication problem - they don't know what they are supposed to do
2. Training problem - they know what to do, but not how
3. Selection problem - they are not capable of doing what they are asked
4. Insubordination - they refuse to do what they are asked
5. Motivation problem - they haven't been given the reason for why they should do it

### Issues with Extrinsic Motivation
- Overemphasize competition over collaboration
- Foster a “what’s in it for me” mentality
- Counteract workplace fairness and equity
- Confuse expectations

### Individualizing Approaches
- Directing - "tell" approach. Detailed instructions.
- Coaching - combination of direction and discussion. Specific about what needs to be done, but engages employee in discussion on how to proceed.
- Facilitating - leader provides clarity on goal and removes obstacles but primarily employee is responsible for determining their own path.
- Training - one-on-one or in a group.
- Mentoring - personal sharing of experiences and tips for success.
- Delegating - team members are given responsibility, accountability, and credit for tasks or projects.

### Strengths-based approach
Looks to harness the strengths and passions of individual members of the team

1. Supports relationship building
2. Increases engagement
3. Stronger overall performance

### Summary
Being a team leader requires having a clear vision regarding the team’s shared purpose and direction. But that doesn’t mean treating everyone on your team the same. Every team member brings their own individual experiences, skills, interests, and perspectives-- as a result, they each need something different from you as a leader. Shake-up your leadership approach by drawing on the specific tools and strategies that will bring out the best in each member of your team.  

## Module 2.6 - Diversity & Inclusion

### Benefits
- Variety of viewpoints
- Broader service range
- Increased adaptability

### Inclusion
Inclusion is the extent to which the work environment is organized and operates to ensure that all employees are treated fairly and respectfully, with access to the opportunities and resources that they need to succeed in their roles and grow as individuals.

### How to talk about diversity and promote inclusion in authentic, meaningful ways
- Avoid tokenism 
- Be mindful of your language and practice using more inclusive language, such as universal phrases and gender-neutral pronouns
- Familiarize yourself with existing workplace diversity policies
- Talk openly about your family, interests, and values, and leave space for others to do the same
- When you are not sure, ask

> Diversity is being invited to the party. Inclusion is being asked to dance. ~ Verna Myers

### Intersectionality
- Compounded experiences of discrimination that cannot be separated from each other.
- Intersectionality reminds us that even individuals who share identity categories do not all experience discrimination and prejudice in the same ways.

### Summary
At the end of the day, every individual brings unique traits, experiences and perspectives-- which is why supporting diversity in the workplace is NOT about filling quotas-- it’s about making sure that everyone feels seen, supported and has a sense of belonging within the work environment.

## Module 2.7 - Seeing your team as whole people

### Languages of Appreciation
1. Words of affirmation - verbal or written, public or private (depends on the individual). Make them specific.
2. Tangible gifts - personalize the gift.
3. Acts of service - offering helpful hand.
4. Quality time - 1:1, coffee, bbq, etc.
5. Physical touch - handshake, fist bump. Only 5% appreciate this.

### Steps to help team feel supported as whole people
1. Check in
2. Know your limits
3. Be mindful

### How to address mental health in the workplace
1. Familiarize yourself with existing mental health policies.
2. Treat people as individuals.
3. Direct your team to company resources.

### Summary
With everything each member of your team is juggling-- at work and at home-- it is unreasonable to expect that they’re always going to be their best, most productive, creative, and efficient selves. What you don’t want to see happen is for that pattern to become too entrenched on a regular basis.

## Module 2.8 - Bringing it all Together

### Thinking Hats
1. White: Information - identifies available data and considers facts
2. Red: Emotion - intuitive reactions or expressions based on feelings
3. Blue: Thinking - observes the thinking process itself
4. Green: Creativity - statements of provocation, investigation and exploration
5. Yellow: Positive Judgement - the application of logic to identify opportunities, consistency, and harmony
6. Black: Negative Judgement - the application of logic to identify mistakes, barriers or potential misalignment

Use these for parallel thinking - following one idea from beginning to end before discussing a competing idea. Use the hats to look at the idea from different perspectives.

### Summary
When it comes to exploring situations and ideas across a range of different perspectives, your team is your biggest asset. Create structures and implement strategies that allow your team to share their thoughts, showcase their skills, and ultimately, take pride in what they contribute to the team.
